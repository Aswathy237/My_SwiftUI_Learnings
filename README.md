# My SwiftUI Learnings

## Project 1 : PkdTourism
In the first Projects I learnt about HStacks and VStacks, zoom in and out functionality along with navigation from one screen to another.

## Project 2: WhatsTheWeather
 Api call was made from "openweather.org". Made use of Decodable concept as well.
